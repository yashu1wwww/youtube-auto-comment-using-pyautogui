youtube auto comment using pyautogui in python

Download the latest version of Chrome Driver from https://chromedriver.chromium.org/. Extract the file and place it in a folder. Open the command prompt in that particular folder and enter "p.py" or double-click on "p.py". Alternatively, you can rename the file and run it.

When you run the "p.py" file, it will ask you to enter a comment. You must enter some text. It will ask for this ten times.

After that, open YouTube and scroll to the comment box. The program will automatically comment the word you entered earlier.

Note:

If your Selenium version is the latest, then the code may not run
and hit enter

and

python -c "import selenium; print(selenium.version)"
